# Data Mining Team Project

## Summary 
Our team was tasked with classifying the income of people found in the Census database. 
We classified the incomes as above or equal to $50K and below $50K. 

## Data Cleaning
Starting by cleaning the data to handle imbalanced or missing data, we began cleaning both training and testing data by 

- Shaping the dataset into dataframes
- Renaming column names and deleting irrelevant columns
- Checking for imbalance and missing value
- Changing certain dependent variables to binary flag in preparation of further modeling

## Algorithms Used
We ran and compared the popular classification algorithms:

- K Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines (SVM).
